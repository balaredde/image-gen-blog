## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### ### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18.x or higher recommended)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)
* A [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) account for the database.

### ### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/AI-IMAGE-GEN.git](https://github.com/your-username/AI-IMAGE-GEN.git)
    cd AI-IMAGE-GEN
    ```

2.  **Set up the Backend**
    ```sh
    # Navigate to the server directory
    cd server

    # Install dependencies
    npm install

    # Create a .env file in this directory (server/)
    # and fill it with your credentials (see template below)
    ```

3.  **Set up the Frontend**
    ```sh
    # Navigate to the client directory from the root
    cd ../client

    # Install dependencies
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Run the Application**
    You'll need two separate terminals open to run both the backend and frontend servers.

    * **In your first terminal (for the backend):**
        ```sh
        cd server
        npm run dev
        ```
    * **In your second terminal (for the frontend):**
        ```sh
        cd client
        npm run dev
        ```

Your application should now be running, with the frontend available at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port specified by Vite) and the backend at `http://localhost:8080`.

# Server Port
PORT=8080

# JWT Secret for User Authentication
# Use a long, random string for security
JWT_SECRET="your_super_secret_key"

# Cloudinary Credentials
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME="your_cloud_name"
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY="your_api_key"
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET="your_api_secret"

# Stability AI API Key
STABILITY_API_KEY="your_stability_ai_api_key"
```
